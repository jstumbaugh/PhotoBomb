Netflix - This is the best site to stream shows for because it has a wide variety of shows to select from. It can be difficult to navigate at times though because it is not always clear where your list of selected shows is located.

Hulu - This site is second in that it has a more current selection of shows. It is easy to search and watch shows and your account is always located in the top left to access your shows anywhere on the site.

YouTube - This site is not the best for TV shows as it is more catered to smaller, amateur videos. It is easy to search for shows but the selection is very small an can be difficult to use at times.
